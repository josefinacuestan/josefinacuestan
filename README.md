### Ongoing Projects
* **PhD Thesis:** Comprehensive study of spatiotemporal biodiversity indicators in the San Matías Gulf.
* **Trawl Survey Optimization:** Investigating the effects of changing sampling effort on diversity estimates.

### Past Projects
* [**PhD Challenges in Argentina:**](https://ojs.ecologiaaustral.com.ar/index.php/Ecologia_Austral/article/view/2588) We investigated the socio-economic and institutional challenges of conducting doctoral research in Argentina.
* [**Mollusk Diversity in Patagonia:**](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-025-03082-1?urlappend=%3Futm_source%3Dresearchgate.net%26utm_medium%3Darticle) Contributed to the analysis of alpha and beta diversity patterns of mollusk assemblages in the tidal flats of northern Patagonia.

* [**Marine Fish Range Shifts:**](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15970?urlappend=%3Futm_source%3Dresearchgate.net%26utm_medium%3Darticle)Contributed to a literature review on traits related to distributional range shifts of marine fishes in response to environmental changes.

* [**Functional Turnover in Demersal Assemblages:**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2023.102452) Led an investigation on how species turnover drives functional diversity and nestedness in Patagonian demersal fish communities.
